# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content here or
# use code similar to line 20 for the files.  If you are producing in a different
# format than PDF, you can delete or ignore lines 20-31 in this YAML header.

  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00-abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')`
# If you'd rather include the preliminary content in files instead of inline
# like below, use a command like that for the abstract above.  Note that a tab is 
# needed on the line after the |.

  You can have a dedication here if you wish.

  This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

<!-- The {.unnumbered} option here means that the introduction will be "Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers
on chapters.
